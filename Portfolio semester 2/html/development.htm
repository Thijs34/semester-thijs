          <h4 class="h41">Recreating the <span>ssc website</span></h4>
          <p>In our first technical skills lesson we were tasked with recreating the ssc website from Eindhoven. I managed to recreate it successfully, producing an end product that met the desired objectives. My final version of the website had a visually appealing design, while also being responsive with correct use of semantic elements. With careful attention to the code structure I was able to deliver a website that satisfied both the requirements and expectation of the teacher. You can play with the website by clicking on the button down below:

            <div class="textboxx">
              <p>To reach this endpoint I initially had some issues to be resolved. While my first delivery of the website was visually appealing, it was not responsive and did not have the correct semantic elements. As you can see in the picture I made use of too many divs that have no semantic meaning. This makes the code a little hard to read and comprehend.  After recognising this issue I got some valuable instructions and feedback from my teacher. This feedback also included the use of flexboxes to make sure the whole page is responsive. This was some valuable information because I gave all my boxes a fixed width and height to put them next to each other. I recognized that this made the website look a bit unprofessional.

            <div class="textboxx">
              <p>In response to the feedback I decided to completely redo my code. I made sure to research the semantic elements before using any divs. This way I learned about new semantics like, figure, figure caption and article. After applying my new found knowledge, my new code had a good structure and was easy to understand. I also made sure to use flex boxes to make the website responsive and usable on most devices. See the picture for the correct version of my code.

            <p>Recreating the website of SSC Eindhoven was a rewarding experience, despite some areas of improvement the assignment was successfully completed, providing a nice learning experience.
