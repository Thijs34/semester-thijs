              <p>In my pursuit of personal growth, I&#39;ve decided to set a meaningful goal for self-improvement. I am dedicated to enhance my time management skills by addressing the habit of delaying my work that often leads to stressful, last minute efforts to meet certain deadlines. Currently I am at the half point on my progress on a staircase that is ten steps long. I always succeed in reaching deadlines on time, but that's because of long hours around the end  of the deadline, that's why I put myself on step 5. To move from step 5 to 6, I&#39;ve devised a strategic plan to further advance my journey. I have set this goal in week 6 and will update it every week until I reach the final step. After that I will set a new goeal for myself.</p>
              <p>To make it to step 6 I am going to create a schedule. In this schedule I will create a priority list, set realistic goals, have some time blocking (meaning to take rest when needed), be specific, flexible and prioritize my self-care. Of course I need to stay consistent in the schedule I make, because this is the key to breaking this bad habit of mine. </p>

              <p>During the last few months in my ICT studies, with particular focus on the media profile, I&#39;ve experienced a significant transformation in my perspective and aspirations, especially when it comes to web development. It&#39;s important to note that prior to enrolling in this study, I had absolutely no experience in coding, making where I am now all the more exciting.</p>
              <p>These past few months have been really informing to me, as I&#39;ve not only acquired new technical skills but also began really liking the art of web developing. What was initially an unfamiliar territory has gradually transformed into an area of creativity and problem solving. It really brings joy to mee to see a finished product after weeks of work.</p>
              <p>This newfound passion is something I would like to be beyond my education and hopefully make it my job someday. To make this a reality I of course have to keep expanding my knowledge, have to keep coding and keep designing. I look forward to the challenges that await.</p>

              <p>During our AI workshop, I gained some valuable insights and tools that will be really helpful and benefit my feature in the field of media. Our first workshop gave me some time to experiment with AI image tools designed to facilitate art creations without the necessity of manual drawing.</p>
              <p>For our first assignment we had to create some art pieces for a game set in a dystopian world. As I started to experiment with some image AI tools, I found myself impressed with the results that were generated, as you can see in the picture. This experience showed me the potential a tool like this has, partially for individuals like me, who do not possess strong drawing skills. These tools will serve as a great inspiration source for future projects in my media career.</p>
              <p>In a rapidly changing media landscape, the ability to adapt and leverage cutting-edge technologies like AI is crucial.  By using these tools and the opportunities they gave, I can produce compelling and unique content for future products.</p>
              <h5 class="subheading">AI prototype</h5>
              <p>For our second assignment, we embarked on the exciting journey of crafting prototypes for our main project, which involves creating a portfolio website for our client. This task brought us face-to-face with a remarkable tool known as "Hocoos," an AI-powered solution that can generate an entire website from just a bit of text input. Although this AI tool offers significant advantages, it does come with certain limitations. Nevertheless, these limitations turn out to be quite advantageous when it comes to prototyping.</p>
              <p>While Hocoos proved to be a user-friendly and efficient tool, I must admit that I like tools like Figma a bit more. Figma, with its flexibility and creativity, provides a broader canvas for me to express my design ideas and artistic vision into the project. To see the prototype click the button below...</p>

              <h5 class="subheading">AI Debate</h5>
              <p>Throughout our Ai exploration, we had a big debate about if Ai is good or evil. Personally, my stance on this matter finds itself somewhat on a 50/50 divide, leaning more towards the good side.</p>
              <p>On one hand, I believe that Ai is an incredibly powerful tool that can be a game changer in my professional journey. It has the ability to make long tedious tasks significantly more efficient. This aspect alone I think is very nice, because it boosts my productivity.</p>
              <p>However, the other part of me occasionally finds itself contemplating how significant the implementation of AI will be. I can not help but wonder if AI might end up taking many job sectors potentially leading up to job displacement.</p>

              <p>In essence, my viewpoint remains balanced. I recognize both the potential and dangers of it. It is a topic that continues to intrigue me and fuels my curiosity in the evolving landscape of technologie.  </p>
