              <p>In my pursuit of personal growth, I&#39;ve decided to set a meaningful goal for self-improvement. I am dedicated to enhance my time management skills by addressing the habit of delaying my work that often leads to stressful, last minute efforts to meet certain deadlines. Currently I am at the half point on my progress on a staircase that is ten steps long. I always succeed in reaching deadlines on time, but that's because of long hours around the end  of the deadline, that's why I put myself on step 5. To move from step 5 to 6, I&#39;ve devised a strategic plan to further advance my journey. I have set this goal in week 6 and will update it every week until I reach the final step. After that I will set a new goeal for myself.</p>
              <p>To make it to step 6 I am going to create a schedule. In this schedule I will create a priority list, set realistic goals, have some time blocking (meaning to take rest when needed), be specific, flexible and prioritize my self-care. Of course I need to stay consistent in the schedule I make, because this is the key to breaking this bad habit of mine. </p>

              <p>During the last few months in my ICT studies, with particular focus on the media profile, I&#39;ve experienced a significant transformation in my perspective and aspirations, especially when it comes to web development. It&#39;s important to note that prior to enrolling in this study, I had absolutely no experience in coding, making where I am now all the more exciting.</p>
              <p>These past few months have been really informing to me, as I&#39;ve not only acquired new technical skills but also began really liking the art of web developing. What was initially an unfamiliar territory has gradually transformed into an area of creativity and problem solving. It really brings joy to mee to see a finished product after weeks of work.</p>
              <p>This newfound passion is something I would like to be beyond my education and hopefully make it my job someday. To make this a reality I of course have to keep expanding my knowledge, have to keep coding and keep designing. I look forward to the challenges that await.</p>
