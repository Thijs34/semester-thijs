          <h4 class="h41">Recreating the <span>ssc website</span></h4>
          <p>In our first technical skills lesson we were tasked with recreating the ssc website from Eindhoven. I managed to recreate it successfully, producing an end product that met the desired objectives. My final version of the website had a visually appealing design, while also being responsive with correct use of semantic elements. With careful attention to the code structure I was able to deliver a website that satisfied both the requirements and expectation of the teacher. You can play with the website by clicking on the button down below:

            <figcaption class="textboxx">
              <p>To reach this endpoint I initially had some issues to be resolved. While my first delivery of the website was visually appealing, it was not responsive and did not have the correct semantic elements. As you can see in the picture I made use of too many divs that have no semantic meaning. This makes the code a little hard to read and comprehend.  After recognising this issue I got some valuable instructions and feedback from my teacher. This feedback also included the use of flexboxes to make sure the whole page is responsive. This was some valuable information because I gave all my boxes a fixed width and height to put them next to each other. I recognized that this made the website look a bit unprofessional.

            <figcaption class="textboxx">
              <p>In response to the feedback I decided to completely redo my code. I made sure to research the semantic elements before using any divs. This way I learned about new semantics like, figure, figure caption and article. After applying my new found knowledge, my new code had a good structure and was easy to understand. I also made sure to use flex boxes to make the website responsive and usable on most devices.

          <h4 class="h41">Exploring<span> CSS animation</span></h4>
          <p>Following the redesign of the SSC website I got to learn something new inside of CSS animations. I already had some prior experience with CSS animations from incorporating them into the homepage of my portfolio, albeit at a relative basic level.
          </p>
          <figure class="imagecontainer">

            <figcaption class="textboxx">
              <p>In one of our assignments we were tasked with a challenge to practice the CSS animations. We needed to create a website where the text “welcome to my portfolio” faded in and out of frame. The fading in part was quite easy to do, but making it gradually fade out was a little harder. After some guidance of the teacher I was able to accomplish this with the code you see in the picture. The fading out did not work at the start because I did not implement the in-between step of 50% and put the opacity to 0 at 100% in the keyframe code.

            <p>In summary, this experience was a good reminder to continue learning and researching CSS. It also highlighted the satisfying feeling of learning a new technique that will definitely be helpful in future projects.</p>

        <article class="documentation" id="awwwards">
          <h4 class="h41">Recreating the<span> awwwards website</span></h4>
          <h5 class="subheading">General info</h5>
          <p>For the first main front-end development assignment, I Had the task to replicate one website featured on the awwwards website. The process of selecting a website to replicate had a few challenges, as I aimed to find a balance between a website that wasn&#39;t overly simplistic or excessively complex. The primary focus of the assignment was HTML and CSS, so I sought out a website that would be enjoyable to recreate and achievable primarily using CSS. I finally found a website that met my needs. It is a yacht-themed website found at this link: <a class="blauw" href="https://www.mangustayachts.com/" target="_blank">https://www.mangustayachts.com/</a></p>
          <p>Click the button below to see my creation before the feedback: </p>
          <a href="https://i523591.hera.fhict.nl/awwwards/" target="_blank" class="btn" id="bottom">awwwards website V1</a>
          <h5 class="subheading">challenges</h5>
          <p>During the project, I encountered a few challenges. The first challenge I faced was getting the correct images. Right-clicking on the website was disabled, so I had to navigate through the network-img section inside the inspector mode to retrieve the necessary files. I also encountered some issues with retrieving SVGs from the website, so I downloaded a SVG grabber tool.</p>
          <figure class="imagecontainer">
            <img src="../pictures/code2.png" alt="image of code">
            <figcaption class="textboxx">
              <p>From a coding perspective, the first few steps went rather smoothly. However, I encountered some substantial difficulties when attempting to recreate the image sliders using pure CSS. While most people use javascript to make sliders, I aimed to maximize my CSS usage, aligning with the assignment&#39;s main objective. Getting the position and width of each slide correct was rather difficult. I had to experiment with various positionings before finally coming up with the code you see inside the picture. Furthermore, there were some limitations in the way I could style the buttons to move to the next slide. Nonetheless the end result was visually appealing and fully functional.  
              </p>
              <p>To see the full code of this image slider, checkout my codepen below:</p>

            <img src="../pictures/card_slider.png" alt="image1" id="image-left">
            <figcaption class="textboxx">
              <p class="top">Another issue I was facing is making the card slider using CSS. I adapted the code from the previous slider and made an attempt to modify it, as evident in the accompanying image. Once I successfully managed to create the card slider, I encountered a persistent issue  where the last card was consistently cut off. This was due to overflow hidden but not the main issue, because the card was cut off way too early. To solve this I messed around a lot inside the inspector. In the end there were some conflicting styles I needed to remove. The remaining aspects of the website progressed relatively swiftly.</p>

          </figure>
          <h5 class="subheading">feedback</h5>
          <p>Upon requesting feedback on the Awwwards website, I received a favorable response, with my website being praised for its aesthetics and its impressive presentation in my portfolio. It was a teacher-initiated challenge to explore the implementation of a pure CSS solution for enabling image slider functionality through drag interactions. This challenge, presented by my teacher, is something I eagerly anticipate tackling. Furthermore, I received constructive feedback on the need to make adjustments to certain semantic elements, which I will certainly take into consideration as I continue to work on this project.</p>

            <h5 class="subheading">implementation</h5>
            <figcaption class="textboxx">
              <p>After receiving this challenge for the awwwardswebsite, I immediately started researching ways to implement the snap function for the card slider. It took some time and effort to make the scroll-snap functionality work correctly. Initially, I had to remove the slider buttons and modify several parts of the original code. Additionally, I had to ensure that the horizontal scrolling was visible again. The most challenging part was getting the slider to snap to the correct positions. Eventually, I managed to achieve the desired behavior using the code you can see in the image. If you're interested in exploring the complete code, please check out my CodePen.</p>

              <p>Now, when you open my new website (linked in the button below) on your phone or use inspect mode to simulate the same, you will notice the feature in the slider. As you move through the slider you will see that it snaps into the right frame. Additionally I made some improvement on the image resize of the slider and the footer.</p>

            <h4 class="h42"><span>conclusion:</span></h4>
            <p>In summary, this front-end development assignment, though challenging, taught me the power of creative problem-solving. While not everything matched the original site, the final product was visually appealing and fully functional. It's a valuable step in my journey as a web developer, and I look forward to applying these experiences in future projects.
