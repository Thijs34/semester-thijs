        <h4 class="h41">Constructing a<span> Survey</span></h4>
        <p>To get a better understanding of the preferences and expectations of our target audience for the portfolio website we are developing for our client, we decided to construct a survey. I was in charge of creating the majority of the questions and reaching out to some art teachers and students, as they are the individuals most likely to engage with an artist or researchers portfolio website. </p>
        <p>When asking for some feedback on the first version of the question, I was made aware to use less open questions and use easier sentences to make sure the survey was understandable and easy to analyze. After using this feedback I was able to make some nice questions.</p>
        <figure class="imagecontainer">
          <img src="../pictures/survey1.png" alt="image for survey stat" class="image3">
          <figcaption class="textboxx">
            <p>One of the important questions we asked was: Do you prefer a minimalistic design, or an expressive design? &#40 meaning a website with fancy animation, colors e.t.c.? &#41 As you can see in the picture most people prefer a minimalistic design. This will help us focus on making designs and several prototypes that takes this user feedback into consideration. Of course we first need the client&#39;s approval before we can develop this idea into the real website. But luckily we already had an interview with her were she shared the same preference. </p>
            <p>All the responses we received from this survey have proven to be immensely valuable. Because I think it gives a wealth of information that will play a big role in shaping the final product. The goal is to align the desires of the potential users with the client, to create a product that is appealing to all. If you want to see the full question list you can click on the button below:</p>

            <p>In conclusion, our survey has provided vital insights into the preferences of our target audience for the portfolio website. The clear preference for minimalistic design, as indicated in the survey results, will be a key driver in our design and prototyping process. This data aligns with the client's own preferences, helping us work toward a product that satisfies both users and our client.</p>

            <p>After receiving some answers on our survey, we embarked on the process of crafting some user personas. I was in charge of creating one of them, which was proven to be a valuable tool for gaining some insights into the user preferences, as you can see in the accompanying image. It will also be very important moving forward into our project, since we want our website to be user friendly.</p>
            <p>The persona I constructed revolves around Mike, a seasoned graphic designer with more than a decade of experience. In our survey analysis we identified some of his primary requirements like a minimalist design, a robust search filter feature and a seamless integration with social media.</p>
            <p>When I asked for some feedback on this persona, I was pleased to receive a great deal of praise for having the persona well-supported by our research. The  survey as I said before was thoughtfully shared with both art teachers and student, resulting in a quite diverse group. Click the button below to vieuw the full persona.</p>

            <h5 class="subheading">challenges</h5>
            <p>To develop my portfolio I had to do some research to discover creative ways to showcase all my accomplishments and progress. After looking for some examples I decided to create an article style portfolio utilizing some grid layout for the text. However I encountered some hurdles along the way. The resizing of the small images you can see in the picture presented a challenge and the legibility of the accompanying text became an issue. Seeking some valuable input, I decided to go to the teacher for some feedback, who arrived at a similar assessment. You can take a look at the image of how my portfolio previously looked like. After considering my options I decided to completely redo this information page since I was not really happy with the state it was in.
            </p>
            <h5 class="subheading">solution</h5>
            <p>After receiving feedback from my teacher, I made the decision to design a page that emulates the appearance of a blog post. This approach allowed me to organize my content in a coherent and easily readable manner. To enhance clarity, I strategically positioned text alongside corresponding images, grouping them together effectively. Additionally, I incorporated buttons that provide convenient links to the documents I created over the past few weeks. By adopting this layout, I aimed to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience for viewers.</p>
