        <h4 class="h41">Exploring<span> colors</span></h4>
        <p>In the first lecture of media production, we delved into the world of colors. While I had some previous understanding of fundamental concepts like primary, secondary and tertiary colors, as well as the color wheel, this lecture introduced me to a host of new terms like hue, tint, tone and shade.Additionally, I learned about various color schemes, including analogous and complementary ones, which I think will be really valuable in making decisions about colors for projects like websites and logos. Selecting the right colors is often a hard task for me, because it is a crucial decision that can impact a product&#39;s performance.

            <p>To practice my color-matching skills, I was given a fun game that involved matching the right hues, saturation, complementary, analogous, triadic and tetradic colors (found on <a class="blauw" target="_blank" href="https://color.method.ac/">https://color.method.ac/</a>). In my first attempt I achieved an impressive score of 9.5. I couldn&#39;t resist giving it another go. My second attempt had an even higher score of 9.8, as you see in the picture. Tho having a high color depth display probably helps a lot with this.

        <h4 class="h41">Exploring<span> Image formats</span></h4>
        <p>During a lecture of the media production course, I gained some valuable insights about image formats that will definitely be helpful in future projects. One significant point is this lecture was to avoid using JPEGs when editing a photo, instead use png because as it preserves the quality</p>
        <p>Additionally, I received a glimpse into the evolving landscape of video delivery formats. It appears that AV1 and H.264 are emerging as primary contenders in this realm. I also discovered that for video editing purposes, the DNx ProRes format is currently the way to go.</p>

          <p>In conclusion, this lesson in media production showed me the significant importance of image formats and the evolving landscape of video delivery. You want to deliver an end product in the highest quality possible, this lecture provided me with a solid foundation to do so in future endeavors.</p>

        <h4 class="h41">Learning<span> Typography</span></h4>
        <p>During a captivating session in media production, I dove into the world of typography. Here I acquired some insights into different fonts or typefaces, distinguishing between serifs and the modern sans serif. I also learned some new terms like kerning, tracking and leading that helps with fine tuning text. To practice kerning  we did another game <a href="https://type.method.ac/" class="blauw">(https://type.method.ac/)</a> that was actually quite hard. I got 84% on my first try.

            <p>Moreover, I discovered that typefaces are more than stylistic choices, they convey messages and set a tone for the content they represent. You probably wouldn't go swimming if you saw a message like in the picture. Probably not many people would make a typeface choice like that, but it shows the importance of picking the right one.

          <p>In conclusion, exploring and experimenting with typefaces has shown me its significance. Typefaces communicate messages that can greatly affect your product. Knowing this will definitely be helpful in future projects like the logo design.

        <h4 class="h41">Designing a <span>logo</span></h4>
        <h5 class="subheading">Practice</h5>
        <p>In week 5 of the media production journey, we ventured into the realm of logo design. To master the art of logo design we first had to analyze some examples of bad. By studying their shortcomings, we can learn from their mistakes and craft a more compelling logo. </p>
        <figure class="imagecontainer">
          <img src="../pictures/logo-practise.jpg" alt="image1" class="image3">
          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>To put this lesson into practise, we engaged in crafting some logos on paper. My teammate and I undertook the challenge of designing a logo for our group project. Our group name is Hephaestus (greek god of blacksmiths). We tried to make his initials into a hammer that strikes an anvil, as illustrated in the picture. While these are merely rough drafts, they provided us with a foundation to further the logo development. </p>
            </p>
            <h5 class="subheading">logo background info</h5>
            <p>Now we venture into the first major task of media production, where I will share my journey of making the logo for a fictional brand. To start, I embarked on a brainstorming journey to determine the category of which I would design the logo. After a while I decided to create a logo for a fictional vintage clothing company named “retrograde”. The name itself suggest a backward movement, which is a nod to the past and vintage fashion.

          <div class="textboxx">
            <h5 class="subheading">iteration 1</h5>
            <p>I chose Adobe Illustrator as my design tool, because it has a status as the go-to program for professionals in the field. After studying this tool and some existing logos for inspiration, I decided to begin with a circular base and incorporated retro-style text within it, as you can see in the accompanying picture. The typeface I used is called “scripto” which looked quite good as a starting point. I then added a thick layer to the back of the text to make it jump out a bit more. While it was a promising start, I felt that the design lacked some color and the style I envisioned.

          <div class="textboxx">
            <h5 class="subheading">iteration 2</h5>
            <p>To improve on my first design I decided to experiment with some additional colors and extra layers to the circle. In this stage I also decided to put a slogan inside the logo “classic roots, modern revival” to further enhance the retro-vintage feeling. Secondly I added at the bottom “family business since 1960 to create the same vibe and make it look symmetrical. At last I added “manufactured in Eindhoven" to finish its look. This version started to look like the real deal, but I still felt there was something missing. The colors still looked off to me and I was not completely happy with the typeface.</p>

        <figure class="logo-container">
          <h5 class="subheading">final version</h5>
          <p>To make the final version of my logo, I looked for a better typeface and found the “Groovy Script” font, which beautifully aligned with the vintage style message I aimed to convey. This transition also made me discover a nice color palette (#181a47, #1c738a, #75ac9e, #db4818 and #df7a2a) that completed the vintage style I sought to embody. During this period I also added three more layers to the text, enhancing its prominence. As a finishing touch, I applied a mask to the entire logo, creating a weathered, “scratched” appearance to further reinforce the vintage aesthetic. Underneath you see the final version, along with a mockup featuring the logo on a store bag.</p>

          <h4 class="h42"><span>conclusion:</span></h4>
          <p>Making my first real logo for a fictional brand was an exciting journey. The transformation of this logo from its humble beginnings to its final form was fun to see. It is a reminder that with dedication and the right tools I can bring my visions to life.</p>
