        <h4 class="h41">Exploring<span> User Experience</span></h4>
        <p>In our first UX lecture we were tasked to find examples of products (digital or physical), that had either good or bad designs. This exercise allowed me to explore and analyze different aspects of design and the impact it has on the user experience. When finding a product I focused on the overall user-friendliness to get an idea what made a product successful and others less so. 
        </p>
        <h5 class="subheading">Good design</h5>
        <figure class="imagecontainer">
          <img src="../pictures/good design.jpg" alt="image1" class="image3">
          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>When looking for A good product I decided to go for the card holder. I think it is an excellent example of a well-designed product that is practical and convenient to its users. The card holder is compact and slim allowing for easy portability in pockets without adding unnecessary bulk. <br> <br> When I analyzed this product I realized what a good designed product actually means. It is something that seamlessly combines functionality, practicality, and aesthetics to enhance the user experience.   
            </p>
          </div>
        </figure>
        <h5 class="subheading2">Bad design</h5>
        <figure class="imagecontainer2">
          <img src="../pictures/bad design.jpg" alt="image1" class="image2">
          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>For the bad design product I decided to go for the cotton swab holder. While it serves the purpose of storing the swabs nicely, there are some issues with its usability. The main problem is that the swabs get frequently stuck in the holder, which could have been easily avoided if the diameter of the opening was bigger.</p>
            <p>After analyzing the product I understood why certain products have a poor design. It often stems from 2 factors. 1: lack of user research. This designer probably failed to conduct thorough research. 2: Ignoring usability principles. The designer of this product overlooked the user friendliness of his design</p>

          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>During the process of developing my portfolio website, I took the action of creating some prototypes to help me visualize my vision. As you can see I decided to go for a blue color scheme, because I learned in the media production course it is a color that represents trust. I thought this would be a nice touch. As you can see from the picture, a lot of the elements from my prototype ended up in the final design. I wanted to create a clean and minimalistic look, which I think I did a pretty good job on.</p>

        <h4 class="h41">Exploring<span> Empathy mapping</span></h4>
        <p>In the second week of the UX journey, I had the opportunity to learn about empathy mapping. It is a nice technique that helps us gain a deeper insight into the thoughts, emotions, behaviors and needs of our target audience and users. It sort of puts yourself in their shoes to understand their perspective. This way you can make a product that really resonates with them.</p>
        <p>I decided to do My empathy map on wanting to work out more. While I got questioned about this (what problem are you facing?, what are your thoughts?, what do you do?, how do you feel?) I gained a deeper understanding of my motivations and challenges. I was able to identify certain barriers, like the lack of knowledge of what workout to do. After showcasing the end product to the teacher I got a postive reaction, The only thing I should change in the future is asking less directed question to get even more open answers.

        <div class="conclusion2">
          <h4 class="h43"><span>conclusion:</span></h4>
          <p>Personally, I think empathy mapping is a great way to strengthen our professional identity. By understanding the needs and emotions of users we can create a meaningful experience. I also think it has some nice potential to be used in our main project.</p>

        <h4 class="h41">Exploring<span> Comparison analysis</span></h4>
        <p>In week 3 of the UX course, I delved into the concept of making comparison analysis. To practice this I decided to compare netflix and disney plus to see how they differ from each other and highlight what makes them successful. The most important comparison was the interface, because this is what the users interact with every day. The feedback on this assignment was to focus a bit more on this comparison</p>
        <h5 class="subheading">Netflix</h5>
        <figure class="imagecontainer">
          <img src="../pictures/netflix interface.png" alt="image1" class="image3">
          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>When you look at the Netflix interface for example you can see that they first prominently showcase a featured movie in a bid heading. Beneath it you see some recommended movies based on the shows you watched previously. This is a great feature that aids in a better user experience for several reasons. 1: It gives clarity. The header draws your immediate attention so you can easily see what Netflix is highlighting. 2: it is engaging. Highlighting a featured movie  encourages the user to explore more content. 3: it adds personalization. By giving recommended movies the user will find likable content faster.   
            </p>

        <h5 class="subheading2">Disney</h5>

          <img src="../pictures/disney-interface.jpeg" alt="image1" class="image2">
          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>Disney plus shares many similarities with Netflix, like showcasing feature movies. But what is noticeably different is the way it tries to take the users attention. 1: content prioritization. Disney places a strong emphasis on popular IPs like Star wars. 2: list presentation. Unlike Netflix single featured movies, disney offers an entire list close to the home page. This will allow users to find new movies in an easy way. 3: Disney tends to present the content in a more compact way. This could have a negative impact on the user experience. After asking a bit around I found out that most people preferred the layout of netflix. </p>

          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>In week 4 of the UX journey I had the opportunity to do an observation challenge, to take a look at how real users interacted with a product. I decided to observe the way people checked in and out of the train station in Eindhoven at peak hours to get the most information in a short time. In short, this observation journey had a range of user experiences, including difficulties with the gates not opening or card declining. I also observed the preferred method people used for checking in or out. I noticed that the OV card and phone was the preferred method.</p>

          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>In the fifth week of the UX journey, I learned about writing and creating a user scenario, a skill in designing a user friendly interface. To practice this I decided to write one about trying to buy new Nike shoes on Nike.com. The objective was to simulate a user's experience around the process of purchasing the product from the Nike.com website. Throughout this exercise I also tried to analyze the emotional aspects of the user experience.</p>
            <p>Click the burron below for the full user scenario:</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
          <h4 class="h43"><span>conclusion:</span></h4>
          <p>During the making of this scenario I gained valuable insights into the user behavior, preferences and decision making. I understood the importance of creating an emotionally engaging interface. The feedback on this assignment was really postive, now I need to focus on researching the emotions a bit more and eventually make a customer journey map.  Overall, I quite liked the assignment.</p>

          <div class="textboxx">
            <p>In week 6 of the UX experience I took the user scenario to the next level by crafting a more comprehensive and easy to follow customer journey map. This time the focus was a bit more on the emotional side. I had to imagine being a Nike employee and experience how easy or hard the interface of the website is. As you can see the expectations of the buyer are still quite the same. I tried to imagine the good and bad points in interacting with the website and wrote them all down in steps.

        <div class="conclusion">
          <h4 class="h43"><span>conclusion:</span></h4>
          <p>Week six of the UX course taught me that by focusing on the emotions of the users we gain a deeper understanding of their way of interacting. By identifying pain points we can create an enhanced version of the project. This is something that will definitely be useful in the project to test how users interact with the portfolio. I think it is a nice way to connect with the user.</p>
