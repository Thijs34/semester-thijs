              <p>In our collaborative group project, maintaining effective communication with our client and users is a crucial point. That's why I took it on me to ensure our questions and research progress are shared with our client. In the first few weeks when we were making our survey I reached out via email to send her some similar questions in an interview style. She preferred to react to them through email. By asking her similar question whe could see if there was some common ground in preferences between the client and the potential users. Luckily this was the case, they both wanted a minimalistic design for example. Click the button to see all the interview questions.</p>

              <p>
                The second time I reached out to our client, was when we analyzed some of our survey answers. During this session, it became apparent that both the client and a big portion of users wanted a phone version of the website. This realization unveiled an important, unanswered question - the priority of design between pc and mobile. To address this, I reached out to our client, seeking for her input on this. As of now we are still waiting for a response. The answer to this question can greatly impact the  way we design our website.

            <p>In conclusion, the importance of thoughtful interaction in our group project cannot be overstated. To make our project a success it is important to stay in contact with the client and our users. In essence, staying engaged is the cornerstone of a successful and collaborative project.</p>

              <p>Establishing a robust communication framework within our project group is as vital as the communication between client and users. To facilitate this, we use whatsApp for or day to day messages, whether it is about tardiness, illness or other updates. We use discord to efficiently share and store all our research-related files. Personally, I think staying consistent in this communication is a key factor in making the group dynamic work. This is why I always make sure to let everyone know via WhatsApp if I am late sick e.t.c. This practice ensures everyone remains well-informed and enables us to maintain a seamless workflow.

            <p>In sum, our project group efficient communication strategy, which combines WhatsApp and discord , has proven to be a great asset in our journey towards the project success. By communicating in a timely manner we stay transparent in our collaboration.

              <p>Once we finished conducting our survey for the project, it hit me that we needed to find the perfect group of people to target (target audience). Since our goal is to create a portfolio website for an artist/researcher, I figured it would be best to send the survey to some art students and teachers from my old high school. They're the ones who are most likely to be into this kind of website and interact with it. This way we get some answers that will really help us in designing the prototypes for the website. Depending on how many answers we will receive, I will try to get some more answers from dedicated art groups (discord e.t.c.).</p>
